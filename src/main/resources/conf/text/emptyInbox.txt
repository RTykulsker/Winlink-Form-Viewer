Inbox directory: ${inboxDir} is empty.

Place one or more Winlink "view" files into the inbox directory. The most recently modified file will be used.

You can also specify an explicit "view file" by using the following command:
	$ fv-file <path-to-specific-view-file>
	
Or you can start the built-in web server by using the following command:
	$ fv-server 

Exiting!
