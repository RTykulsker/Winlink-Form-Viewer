This is fv, a Winlink Form Viewer, version 0.5.2.

FV works in conjunction with with Winlink Express (WE).
FV combines the small "view" file transmitted by WE with the the
associated form (which is not transmitted). The result is then displayed
in a browser. This is very useful when the view file is transmitted by
regular (SMTP) email version radio (WE) email

FV can operate in several modes, each with a corresponding script in the
$FV_HOME/bin directory:
-- fv-file: read the view file supplied on the command line

-- fv-inbox: read the most most recent view file found in the inbox.
  The default location for the inbox is $FV_HOME/conf/inbox, but you can
  override this in the configuration file (see below).

-- fv-server: start as a web server that allows you to "upload" or use
  "drag-and-drop". After displaying a form, you can specify another file
  by refreshing your browser (typically, F5). The server listens on port
  6676 by default, but you can change this via the configuration file
  (see below).

-- fv-update: this attempts to check whether the version of the forms
  library used is up to date with the version supplied by WE. If not, it
  attempts to download and install the most up to date version. This is
  an experimental feature and is likely to break as the Winlink team
  change how they handle updates. If necessary, you can manually install
  a new forms library. The location is specified in the configuration
  file (see below).

-- fv-help: print this usage message.

FV needs to read a configuration file to properly work. The default
configuration file is located in $FV_HOME/conf/fv.conf. You can use an
alternative configuration file by specifying with --config-file <name>

FV uses a logging configuration file at $FV_HOME/conf/logback.xml to
control program logging
